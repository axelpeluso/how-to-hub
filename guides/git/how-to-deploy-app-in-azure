How to create an Azure Resource Group, Virtual Machine, and Web App, then deploy a ZIP application
Goal

Create a resource group, deploy a virtual machine (VM), deploy a web app, configure it, and deploy an application using a ZIP file with environment variables and startup settings.

Prerequisites

The application ZIP file downloaded locally.

Steps
Part 1: Create a Resource Group and Virtual Machine

Go to the Azure portal.

Create a Resource Group (a container that holds related resources).

After the resource group is created, confirm it is empty.

Create a Virtual Machine inside that resource group.

In the VM creation form, set:

Virtual machine name

Region

Configure inbound ports:

Do not leave inbound ports open (to avoid hackers).

(Optional) Add additional items/services to the VM as needed.

Select Review + create.

Wait for:

“Deployment in progress”

“Deployment is complete”

Go to the resource group’s Resources list and confirm the VM appears.

Note that creating a VM automatically creates multiple billable services.

If you are not using the VM, turn it off (you pay for CPUs while services are running).

Part 2: Create a Web App

Create a Web App.

In the Web App setup, configure:

Subscription

Resource group

Web app name

Set Publish to Code.

Select Python as the language.

Start the web app deployment.

Wait for:

“Deployment in progress”

“Deployment succeeded”

Part 3: Configure the Web App and Deploy a ZIP File

Go back to the Resource Group containing the VM and Web App.

Select your Web App.

Go to Settings → Environment variables.

Create a new environment variable:

Name: SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT

Value: true

Select Apply.

Confirm and apply the changes.

Enable Auto-start (if available).

Go to Settings → Configuration (Stack settings).

Add a Startup command.

Select Apply.

Ensure your application ZIP file is downloaded locally.

In the Web App, go to Deployment.

Open Advanced Tools.

Open File Manager.

Navigate to the site folder.

Upload the ZIP file into the site directory.

Notes

A resource group starts empty until you add resources.

Creating a VM generates multiple billable resources automatically.

VMs incur ongoing costs while running.

Setting SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=true ensures the app is built during ZIP deployment.

The application is created from the uploaded ZIP file during deployment.
